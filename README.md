Learn and understand the fundamentals of 3D modeling in Blender.

Gain proficiency in object creation, mesh editing, and scene composition.

Explore material application and lighting techniques for realistic renders.


Accomplishments:

Successfully built a detailed 3D room model from scratch.

Applied various textures and materials to different room elements for realism.

Set up lighting and camera angles to enhance the visual presentation of the scene.


Tools & Techniques:

Blender for 3D modeling, texturing, and rendering.

Use of modifiers and mesh editing for efficient modeling.

Lighting setup including ambient and point lights to simulate realistic environments.


How to View:

Open the Blender project file (.blend) in Blender (version X.X or higher) to explore the 3D room model and inspect the materials and lighting setup.
